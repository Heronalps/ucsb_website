## Course Description

This course explores advanced topics in highly scalable Internet services and
their underlying systems architecture. Software today is increasingly being
delivered as a service: accessible globally via web browsers and mobile
applications and backed by millions of servers. Modern frameworks and platforms
are making it easier to build and deploy these systems, such as Ruby on Rails
and Amazon's EC2.

Yet despite these advances, some concerns just don't go away. Building scalable
Internet services today still requires an understanding of topics like caching,
load balancing, security, and monitoring. In this course we will examine these
topics and more: the state of the art in building scalable Internet services.

## Course Lectures

Course lectures will be Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 3:00pm to 4:50pm in
Phelps 2510. Lecture material will cover the essentials of building large scale
Internet services. The lecture schedule and slides are available online.

## Course Project

The goal of the course project is to gain hands-on experience in building and
deploying a scalable web service on the Internet. Students will do this using
the latest web technologies in order to learn how to tackle scalability and
fault-tolerance concerns. Projects will be conducted in agile teams, and
students will build their own scalable, redundant web site using fundamental
web technologies and the Ruby on Rails framework.

Project-centric lab will meet every Thursday from 5:00pm to 6:50pm in
Phelps 3525.
