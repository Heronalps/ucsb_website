# Project Ideas

* Embrace the sharing economy! Build a time-sharing app for pets. Own 30% of a
  dog.
* Government data project. A system that uses the large amounts of data at
  [data.gov](http://data.gov) or the
  [Amazon public data sets](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/), see the
  [sunlight foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/projects/) projects for
  some ideas.
* Leverage the data from the
  [New York Times Developer APIs](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs) in order
  to build something interesting. They have APIs convering geography, movie
  reviews and more.
* Stock trade advisor. A system that gathers information about stocks, stock
  trades, and companies from both traditional and non-traditional sources
  (blogs, email lists, twitter feeds, facebook) and computes interesting
  data. Potential interesting data would be correlations between stock price
  and both non-traditional data, trending information based on non-traditional
  sources. Could also include social aspects for submitting sources, voting for
  impact of source, etc.
* YCombinator inspired:
  [YC Request for Startups](http://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/) Implement some
  portion of one of the YCombinator "Startup ideas we would like to fund"
* Homebrew, a seed investor, has a list of areas of interest similar to YC's
  RFS: [https://quip.com/rcLXASq4IbIj](https://quip.com/rcLXASq4IbIj)
* Make your own news aggregator. [Techmeme](http://techmeme.com/) has built an
  automated news aggregator that works by crawling news sites/blogs/twitter and
  finding the most popular articles (and authoritative sources based on back
  linking). Can you build a customized news aggregator of stuff you'd be
  interested in based on the people you follow on twitter/facebook (and the
  links they post)?
* Kickstarter Tracker. There are tons of projects launching every day on
  Kickstarter, but it's hard to keep track of what is going. I'd be curious to
  track and see how much money different projects make each day (graphed over
  time). Which projects made the most money today? Which projects are trending
  upwards?
* What should I buy? At any given time tons of people are tweeting links to
  things they just bought on Amazon
  ([twitter search](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct&src=typd))
  can you aggregate that data and make a dashboard that shows what people are
  buying on any given day?  What products are popular? What type of stuff are
  people buying?
