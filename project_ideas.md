# Project Ideas

* Embrace the sharing economy! Build a time-sharing app for pets. Own 30% of a
  dog.
* Government data project. A system that uses the large amounts of data at
  [data.gov](http://data.gov) or the
  [Amazon public data sets](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/), see the
  [sunlight foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/projects/) projects for
  some ideas.
* Leverage the data from the
  [New York Times Developer APIs](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs) in order
  to build something interesting. They have APIs convering geography, movie
  reviews and more.
* Stock trade advisor. A system that gathers information about stocks, stock
  trades, and companies from both traditional and non-traditional sources
  (blogs, email lists, twitter feeds, facebook) and computes interesting
  data. Potential interesting data would be correlations between stock price
  and both non-traditional data, trending information based on non-traditional
  sources. Could also include social aspects for submitting sources, voting for
  impact of source, etc.
* YCombinator inspired:
  [YC Request for Startups](http://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/) Implement some
  portion of one of the YCombinator "Startup ideas we would like to fund"
