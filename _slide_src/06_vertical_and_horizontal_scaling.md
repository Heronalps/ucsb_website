# TODO

## Should be done

* Ruby Codecademy
* Agile Web Development with Rails Chapters 1 through 8
* Familiarity with Git (you'll get more practice)
* [Dynamic Load Balancing on Web-server Systems](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs230/reading/DLB.pdf)
  by Cardellini, Colajanni, and Yu.
* Pivotal contains stories for the entire project
* Github contains base-rails app (and more)

## Before Lab

* Agile Web Development with Rails Chapters 9 through 17
* Make as much progress on Sprint 1 commitment as possible

__Focus__: On delivering new usable features to your customers (Seb and me) for
the next few weeks.

# HTTP Server Architectures

* Single Threaded (no concurrency)
* Process per request
* Process pool
* Thread per request
* Process/thread worker pool
* Event-driven

---

# What are the trade-offs of process-based concurrency?

---

# What are the trade-offs of thread-based concurrency?

---

# What are the trade-offs of event-driven systems?

---

# Scaling Goal

![Load Balanced Topology](img/load_balanced_topology.png)

After today you will understand what load balancing is, and why the depicted
architecture provides smooth cost-effective scaling.

---

# The Problem

You've built something the world (or significant subset) is excited about.

> What do you do when your popularity doubles (again, and again)?

---

# The Solutions

## Vertical Scaling

Buying "bigger" hardware and scaling _up_

* __PRO__: Easy
* __CON__: Limited
* __CON__: Non-linear increase in cost when scaling

## Horizontal Scaling

Buying move servers and scaling _out_

* __PRO__: Easy to add more servers (limited by datacenter space)
* __PRO__: Linear increase in cost when scaling
* __CON__: More moving parts makes things more complicated

---

# Vertical Scaling

When needed, increase the resources of your current server, eventually buy a
bigger server with:

* More memory
* More and/or faster CPUs and/or cores
* Higher bandwidth

---

## EC2 and Vertical Scaling

With Amazon EC2 you rent virtual instances. There are clear vertical scaling
paths. Each type of instance (below) has a few options ranging from lower
resources/performance to higher resources/performance:

* __T__ and __M__ prefixed instances: balanced mix of memory and CPU
* __C__ prefixed instances: CPU optimized
* __R__ prefixed instances: Memory optimized
* __G__ prefixed instances: GPU optimized
* __I__ prefixed instances: I/O optimized
* __D__ prefixed instances: Storage capacity optimized

# Scaling Test: Simulated Users

We will use the same test setup explained in the last lecture.

Using Tsung (erlang-based test framework) we will simulate multiple users
visiting the Demo App web service. Each user will:

    Visit the homepage (/)
      Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
    Request community creation form
      Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
    Submit new community form
    Request new link submission form
      Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
    Submit new link submission form
      Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
    Delete the link
      Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
    Delete the community

---

# Scaling Test: Phases

This time we have twelve phases of testing each lasting 60 seconds:

     1.    (0-59s) Every second a new simulated user arrives
     2.  (60-119s) Every second 1.5 new simulated users arrive
     3. (120-179s) Every second 2 new simulated users arrive
     4. (180-239s) Every second 4 new simulated users arrive
     5. (240-299s) Every second 6 new simulated users arrive
     6. (300-359s) Every second 10 new simulated users arrive
     7. (360-419s) Every second 16 new simulated users arrive
     8. (420-479s) Every second 20 new simulated users arrive
     9. (480-539s) Every second 25 new simulated users arrive
    10. (540-599s) Every second 35 new simulated users arrive
    11. (600-659s) Every second 45 new simulated users arrive
    12. (660-719s) Every second 55 new simulated users arrive

# Load Balancing

Vertical scaling has its place, but horizontal scaling is generally preferable.

When horizontally scaling HTTP, this technique is referred to as __load
balancing__.

## Basic Idea

* Have many servers that can server clients
* Make these servers _appear_ as single endpoint to the outside world

The users' experiences are the same regardless of which server ultimately
handles the request.

---

# Think About It

> How can we enable many servers to serve clients?

Consider the following sequence of actions:

1. GET /products
2. POST /products
3. GET /products

> If these requests are handled by three different servers, will the third
> request show the new product?

---

# Stateless Servers

.fx: img-left

![Load Balanced Topology](img/load_balanced_topology.png)

In order for load balancing to work, the servers must be stateless.

Statelessness can be accomplished by keeping the persistence layer separate
from the application layer.

---

# Load Balancing (1): HTTP Redirects

.fx: img-left

![Load balancing via redirect](img/load_balancing_redirect.png)

Discussed in section 6.1 of the reading.

Implemented using multiple web servers with different domain names.

A request for www.domain.com will use HTTP 301 or 302 to redirect the request
to a pool of possible hosts.

---

# HTTP Redirect Example

    !http
    % nc www.domain.com 80
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    host: www.domain.com

    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    Date: Wed, 15 Oct 2014 21:08:22 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)
    Location: http://www2.domain.com/
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
    ...

---

# HTTP Redirects Trade-offs

## Strengths

* Simple
* Complete control over load balancing algorithm
* Location independent

## Weaknesses

* Not transparent to user
* High load on www
* May reduce local-network cache applicability

---

# Load Balancing (2): Round Robin DNS

.fx: img-left

![Load balancing via round-robin DNS](img/load_balancing_round_robin.png)

Discussed in section 4.1 of the reading.

When user's browser queries DNS for www.example.com, a list of IPs is
returned. The DNS server rotates the list order for each query (or alters
priorities).

User's browser chooses which IP to connect to (generally picks the first, or
highest priority).

---

# Round Robin DNS Example

    % host www.google.com
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.48
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.51
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.52
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.49
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.50

    % host www.google.com
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.49
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.52
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.51
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.50
    www.google.com has address 74.125.224.48

---

# Round Robin DNS Trade-offs

## Strengths

* Simple
* Cheap

## Weaknesses

* Less control over balancing
* Modifying the list is inhibited by caching in the browser and proxies

---

# Load Balancing (3): TCP Load Balancing

.fx: img-left

![Load balancing via TCP](img/load_balancing_tcp.png)


Discussed in section 5 of the reading.

## General Idea

Rewrite TCP packets to send them to the selected server. This includes
addresses, sequence numbers, and checksums.


## Commercial Products (use hardware ASICs to do this fast)

* Cisco Content Services Switch
* Citrix Netscaler
* F5 Big IP

# TCP Load Balancing Trade-offs

## Strengths

* More control over which requests go to which servers
* Works fine with HTTPs

## Weaknesses

* Constrains where the servers can be located (same network)
* Complicated
